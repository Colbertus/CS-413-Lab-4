@ Purpose: implemented a simple four function integer calculator using Assembly

@ The comments below are to assemble, link, run, and debug the program
@ as -o mcclureLab4.o mcclureLab4.s
@ gcc -o mcclureLab4 mcclureLab4.o 
@ ./mcclureLab4
@ gdb --args ./mcclureLab4

OUTPUT = 1 @ Used to set the selected GPIO pins to output only. 
ON     = 1 @ Turn the LED on.
OFF    = 0 @ Turn the LED off.

RED    = 5 @ Pin number from wiringPi for red led
YELLOW = 4 @ Pin number from wiringPi for yellow led
GREEN  = 3 @ Pin number from wiringPi for green led
BLUE   = 2 @ Pin number from wiringPi for blue led
